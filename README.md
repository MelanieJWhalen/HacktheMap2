# Green Your Scene

The Green Your Scene app, written using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET, helps you determine the best location for your next sustainable project. You select a sustainable project type, give a weight to a set of variables (or use default weights), then run the analysis. 

A sustainable project is the addition of equipment, infrastructure, or green businesses, such as solar-powered compacting trash can, vegetative green roofs, or Zipcar stations. For the full list, click the Project Type drop-down on the app.

For example, to determine best candidate locations for a new solar-powered trash compactor, you would select Trash Compactor as the project type. Then you provide a value for each variable to indicate how important the variable is in determining best location for your new project. For example, you'd give a value between -5 and 10 to indicate how important proximity to a parking lot is for the new trash can, where -5 is least important and 10 is most important.
