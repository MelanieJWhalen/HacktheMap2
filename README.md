# Green Your Scene

The Green Your Scene app, written using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET, helps you determine the best location for your next sustainable project in the neighborhood or area you choose. You select a sustainable project type, give a weight to a set of variables (or use default weights), then run the analysis. 

A sustainable project is the addition of equipment, infrastructure, or green businesses, such as solar-powered compacting trash can, vegetative green roofs, or Zipcar stations. For the full list, click the Project Type drop-down on the app.

For example, to determine best candidate locations for a new solar-powered trash compactor, you would select Trash Compactor as the project type. Then you provide a value for each variable to indicate how important the variable is in determining best location for your new project (scale is from -5 to 10 with 10 being the most important). For example, you may give a value of 10 for Proximity to parking lots to indicate that you find it important that the new location be near a parking lot.
