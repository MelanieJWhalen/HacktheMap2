# Find the best sustainable project location

This app, written using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for .NET, lets you select a sustainable project type, give a weight to a set of variables (or use default weights), then run the analysis to find where the best location is for the project. 

A sustainable project is the addition of equipment, infrastructure, or green businesses, such as solar-powered trash compactors, vegetative green roofs, or Zipcar stations.

This app uses analysis to display the best candidate locations for the new project based on a set of criteria for that project type.
